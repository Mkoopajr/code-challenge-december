## Code Exercise in Node & Angular ##
Please complete as much of this as possible in an hour. Fork the repository and work on it from there. It's not the speed at which this project is completed, it's the quality of the code and the reasoning behind it. *Follow the mockup for design.*

### Challenge ####
Ron is new to GitHub and is scared of the internet. Ron is a bit of an ass, but we've been ordered to help Ron search for what he needs on GitHub.

Here's the functional requirements Ron insists on.

 - He needs to be able to run the application locally
 - He needs to connect to the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/)
 - He needs an input field to input his search term
 - The results need to return back on the same page (we can limit it to the first 5, he doesn't want pagination)
 - If the search includes the term "Ron", [rick roll em'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) because he's a narcissist 
 - You can use any Node / Angular libraries you want.


Here's the mockup to base the design on (also under mockup_example.png).


Once you're done with the challenge, submit a pull request back to this source repository.
